# Cynegetic Fund

## Description
Cynegetic Investment Management is developing a token on the Solana network, under the ticker $CYN. This token is part of an innovative initiative to replicate and enhance the quantitative strategies that the company applies in the real world, by combining artificial intelligence with the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) ecosystem. Through this approach, we aim to maximize efficiency and profitability in various operations, including liquidity provision (LP), arbitrage, and price range strategies on DeFi platforms.
